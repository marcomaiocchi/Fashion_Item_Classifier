# Fashion_Item_Classifier
We scrapped data from different online shops such as Zara and we unified the different categories. Scrapping is not very efficient and often some important data to detect the category is missing.  These models classify fashion items with different ML approches based on details found in the description such as type of sleeves, neck, fabric, fantasy and so on. 
The best model tested so far is the random forest. 
These models are useful because, in case of missing data, they suggest us which type of fashion item we are looking at without manually browsing the description. If i consider only the main cateogory I get an accuracy of 99%, for the sub categories (which are almost 100 different types!) i get an accuracy of 90%.
